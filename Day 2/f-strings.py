#this would have been in other stuff but is quite important

score = 0 #int
height = 1.8 #float
isWinning = True #boolean

#normally to convernt these you would have to do str(var) but you can use f see below:

print(f"Your Score is {score}, your height is {height}, and you are winning is {isWinning} ")

#this bit of code automatically converts everything it also means you dont need to use + as its all contained within quotations.
