#This contains stuff i have learend that isnt in bandname.py
#if i wanted to get the length of an input in numbers i would do this

#the computer tries to print it straight away but cannot as it has to calcuate the length (len) of the input. len is another function it calcutes how many numbers  
print(len(input("What is your name?")))

#this is a challange it was to make a switch with b and b switch with a without numbers.
a = input("a: ")
b = input("b: ")

switcha = a
switchb = b
a = switchb
b = switcha

print("a: " + a)
print("b: " + b)
