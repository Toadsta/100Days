#Functions
#I have already used functions, for example:
print("hello"); print(len("hello"))
#we can make our own function! How, we first define (def) a function
def myFunction():#this colon says anything after this line and indented is part of the function
    print("Hello")
    print("Bye")
#to call the function we do this, if it requires input we put stuff inside the ()
myFunction()
#You can put functuions inside of functions to make an easier function for example if you made a turn left function, 
#you could place 2 of them in a new function and call it turn around
def myFunction2():
    #place code here
    #place code here
#this code isnt in function

#while loops
#while loops will continue to run the code until the condition isnt met
while something: #means when its true
while not something: # means when not true

#for loops are good for ranges and doing stuff inside a list (iterations)

#while loops are good for when you want to carry out something until conditon is met
#while loops are more dangerous than for loops as you may accidentaly make an infinite loop
